#Chutes-and-Climbs

A fun digital twist on the classic board game “Snakes and Ladders”

#Project Overview

This project recreates the timeless board game mechanics of “Snakes and Ladders” (also called “Chutes and Climbs”) in a web-based format, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Players roll a virtual die, move their token along the board, and navigate chutes (which send them backwards) and climbs (which move them forwards). It’s simple, interactive, and brings nostalgic fun to the browser.
#Core Features

Virtual die roll to generate movement.

Player token movement across a board of squares.

“Chutes” (or snakes) that slide you backwards if landed upon.

“Climbs” (or ladders) that boost you forward if landed upon.

Clear win condition when a player reaches the final square.

#Technologies Used

HTML for the board layout.

CSS for styling and visual effects.

JavaScript for game logic (die rolls, token movement, chute/climb checks).

No backend required — runs fully in the browser.

#How to Use / Play

Clone or download the repository.

git clone https://github.com/Pallavi-Sen/Chutes-and-Climbs.git


Open index.html in your web browser.

Click the “Roll Die” button to start your turn.

Move your token according to the die value.

If you land on a chute or climb square, you’ll automatically move accordingly.

First player to reach the final square wins — celebrate 🎉

#Why This Matters

Demonstrates fundamentals of web development: DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic.

Serves as a fun, interactive demo or portfolio piece.

Great starting point for enhancements (multiplayer support, animations, scorekeeping, leaderboard).

#Future Enhancements

Add multiplayer support (local or online).

Include animation for token movement, chutes and climbs.

Add a leaderboard to track game stats and wins.

Enhance with sound effects or music.

Make the board customizable (themes, sizes, number of players).
